When the government intervenes to control technology, it affects both companies and their users. For companies like TikTok, the new rules may make it difficult for them to operate and grow. For users, it can mean losing access to the apps they enjoy or worrying about their privacy. In the case of TikTok, the concern is how user data could be shared.
To address these issues, TikTok could store user data within each country and allow independent groups to verify whether the app follows privacy rules. This would help users feel more secure and worry governments less.
If I worked at TikTok, I would add a feature like stronger encryption, meaning users' messages and data would be hidden and safe from hackers or spying. This would show that the company cares about the safety of users.
This situation teaches me that when working on technology projects, I must always think about how to maintain the privacy and security of user data. It is a big responsibility for anyone who creates applications or software.
