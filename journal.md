When the government intervenes to control technology, it affects both companies and their users. For companies like TikTok, the new rules may make it difficult for them to operate and grow. For users, it can mean losing access to the apps they enjoy or worrying about their privacy. In the case of TikTok, the concern is how user data could be shared.
To address these issues, TikTok could store user data within each country and allow independent groups to verify whether the app follows privacy rules. This would help users feel more secure and worry governments less.
If I worked at TikTok, I would add a feature like stronger encryption, meaning users' messages and data would be hidden and safe from hackers or spying. This would show that the company cares about the safety of users.
This situation teaches me that when working on technology projects, I must always think about how to maintain the privacy and security of user data. It is a big responsibility for anyone who creates applications or software.

Government actions can have powerful implications for technology companies and their users, as the case of TikTok demonstrates. This concerns privacy and access to user data, while making companies innovate new features and follow the rules. Basically, what happened with TikTok signals that the need to protect user data against external threats is real.
To address these issues, TikTok could be more open by storing data locally or allowing external controls. As a developer, I would add a feature that allows users to easily view, download, or delete their data. This connects to the class's ideas about secure app development and shows the importance of creating privacy-focused systems that users can trust.
